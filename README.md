# Drift 

 

Drift is a Flappy bird game, made in roughly a day, using [Raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib). The game features a full main menu with custom animation and fully custom button code with colour changes on hover and click. The gameplay is very simple as you press left mouse button or the spacebar to 'jump' and avoid the obstacles. If you get through the obstacles, you get a point, the goal is to get as many points as possible without hitting an obstacle.

### Installation 

- #### For binaries, check out the [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/Zentifyyy/Drift/releases/tag/Release-v1.0-r).

- Clone the repository. 

``` 
git clone https://github.com/Zentifyyy/Drift.git
